# DendroPRS

This repository contains an implementation of the DendroPRS method (publication in submission). An example script for
for analyzing multi-ancestry eQTL is included. Please see the paper for details on accessing full datasets. The repository 
remains under construction, and a user-friendly workflow for running experiments on UKBiobank datasets is forthcoming.
